## Introduction

OxCam is a web based database app designed to support Oxford and/or Cambridge Alumni groups and Societies.
It can be deployed on low cost cloud services such as PythonAnywhere or Linode (Akamai) at very low cost.

- At it's simplest it can be used to maintain mailing lists and send out notices.
- It can track events and provide registration capabilities including payment collection, maintaining a wait
list, etc.
- One or more paid membership categories can be implemented, either sending renewal reminders
or using autopay subscriptions, and collecting dues payments through a payment processor such as
Stripe. Members are provided access to an online directory.
- By uploading transaction files (in .csv format) from banks and payment processors oxcam can maintain comprehensive accounts.
- It can provide dynamic content for the group's web site, for example [about](https://oxcamne.pythonanywhere.com/oxcam/page_show/2), [recent events](https://oxcamne.pythonanywhere.com/oxcam/page_show/4).

A group can choose how much of the above to implement and can expand it's use over time.

The project includes an online [User Guide](https://oxcamne.github.io/oxcam).

For questions, bug reports, feature requests etc. use the Issues forum (to post you need to register on github).

## Prerequisites

OxCam is a [Python](https://www.python.org) App running under the open source web framework [Py4web](https://github.com/web2py/py4web).

OxCam is a web app and these requirements apply to your chosen web server environment:

- Python 3.8+ must be installed. The app has been developed and is currently running on Python 3.10.
- [Py4web](https://py4web.com/_documentation) must also be installed. Please see the [Py4web documentation](https://py4web.com/_documentation) for information on it's installation. There is information on installing Py4web on a variety of environments. If you are installing Py4web on PythonAnywhere, an alternative is to follow [Tutorial: Easily install py4web on PythonAnywhere](https://nicozanf.wordpress.com/2024/03/24/how-to-easily-install-py4web-on-pythonanywhere/).
- You will need to use the Py4web Dashboard for certain operations, so will need to use that password, which is set during Py4web installation.
- git must be installed; you will use it in a terminal session to clone this software from the github repositary, and to pull future updates of OxCam.

## Contributors and Collaborators

The software was developed by David Manns for use in running the Oxford & Cambridge Society of New England. It is Oxford & Cambridge centric in that it is designed for matriculated alumni, who must provide their Oxbridge
College and matriculation list in order to subscribe to mailing lists, register for events, etc.
