## Check-In Tool

This page is reached by clicking on an event name on the [Reservation List](reservation_list.md) and then clicking the "check-in tool" link.

It is designed for use when checking in guests at the event, and so is designed to be smartphone friendly. It can be used by anyone with read access privilege - the only case where this level of privilege can update the database.

The list starts by showing all reservations where at least one confirmed guest (either the host or one of their guests) has not yet checked in. Members' guests are shown with a '+' prefix immediately following the host member.

In the example, typing the initial 'M' in the search box has filtered the list down to a few reservations where either the member or a guest has a matching last name. Clicking on an empty disc will check-in the individual guest. If this is the last guest in a party to be checked in the party is removed from the display, otherwise the disc is filled in, and the remaining guests in the party can be checked-in.

The 'last checked' link is shown after any guest has been checked in, and opens up the [details of that reservation](event_registration.md), even if the reservation is fully checked-in. Ticks in the status column indicate that the guests have been checked in. The 'back' link will return to the check-in tool.

Clicking on a guest name also opens up the reservation details for that party.

To use the search field, start typing the last name of a member or guest. Usually two or three letters will be enough to locate the desired reservation.
