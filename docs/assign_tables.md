## Table Assignment Tool

This page is reached by clicking on an event name on the [Reservation List](reservation_list.md) and then clicking the "table assignment tool" link.

It is designed for use prior to a formal event such as a dinner. The table assignments are included in the exported doorlist.csv file and can be used on name badges.

The page includes a grid initially including all confirmed registered members and guests. Guests not yet assigned a table appear at the top, followed by those in each table in party (member) name order within tables. Guests are shown after their host member with a '+' prefix in front of their name.

To show just the guests assigned to a table, type the table number in the 'table?' box and click filter. Selecting a member in the left hand box, placing a table number in the right hand box and clicking 'Filter' assigns the member and all of their guests to the specified table, and leaves the grid showing the resulting composition of that table, so that additional guests can easily be assigned.

Clicking 'clear' clears the filter boxes and restores the grid to show all confirmed registered guests.
