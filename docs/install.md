# [Oxford/Cambridge Alumni Group Application - Support Guide](support.md)

## Installation

The oxcam software is held on Github at [https://github.com/oxcamne/oxcam](https://github.com/oxcamne/oxcam). This section assumes that you have read the README displayed there and satisfied the pre-requisites, so that you have a web server successfully running Py4web.

On your server open a bash terminal session at the py4web 'apps' directory, issue the commands:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/oxcamne/oxcam.git
    pip install --upgrade -r oxcam/requirements.txt
```

This clones the software into a new directory apps/oxcam, and ensures that necessary Python packages are installed. You may need to precede 'pip' with 'python ' or 'python3 ' depending on your environment.

Note that if you are installing on Pythonanywhere, you can open a bash terminal session (they call this a console) from various places on their site, and that from the 'Files' tab you can edit files, such as the settings file described below.

### Configure the software for your organization

You next need to create a 'settings_private.py' file in apps/oxcam. Customize the contents from the code below, which is taken from the OxCamNE environment (with sensitive keys removed). A copy of this is included in the kit as settings_private_template.py which you can copy or rename:

```python
"""

and for a particular running instance, e.g. production or development
Customize for your organization and instance

SOCIETY_LOGO = 'your_logo_file_name'    #should be placed in py4web/apps/oxcam/static directory
                #Your favicon.ico should also be placed in py4web/apps/oxcam/static directory

DB_URL = f'your_database_server_url'   #e.g. https://{SOCIETY_SHORT_NAME}.pythonanywhere.com/oxcam

Notes:

1. As shown here, the locale is set to the server default settings. It could be set to any supported locale. The  locales supported on the server can be listed using the 'locale' terminal command. Setting the locale determines the date format used and the currency symbol.

1. The database is configured to use SQLite - this probably provides adequate performance
for all but the largest groups.

1. Setting IS_PRODUCTION False only prevents the daily maintenance process from
sending out notices such as membership dues reminders. Any test environment can still send out email, but will suppress all email except to ALLOWED_EMAILS.

1. Set THREAD_SUPPORT True only if your environment supports threading. PythonAnywhere does not, but typically a desktop development environment does. If set True, then the email daemon is started in its own thread whenever py4web/oxcam is started, and in turn spawns the daily_maintenance job in its own thread at midnight.

1. There are various 'branding' elements such as logo, organization name,
web site addresses, help site address (for volunteers), support email, etc.
The help site might embed the [User Guide](https://oxcamne.github.io/oxcam) and
possible also this [support guide](https://oxcamne.github.io/oxcam/support) as
well as including organization specific information.

1. In the prototype membership categories are included for full and student
members, as used by OxCamNE. Adjust as needed. If you do not have paid memberships MEMBERSHIPS should be an empty list, '[]'.

1. The email settings configure two SMTP servers. One is used for transactional emails, such as login email verification, transaction confirms, and emails addressed explicitly, the other for bulk emails, sent to mailing list or filtered sets of members. OxCamNE uses an email service provider which, among other things, ensures that messages are authenticated by SPF and DKIM records. Small groups could use, e.g. a gmail address with an [app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en). In production, for transactional messages we use our google workspace account directly, whereas bulk messages are sent via our email service provider, mailgun. These settings should be present even if you are not using mailing list functionality.

1. PaymentProcessor is a base class for all payment processors that might be supported. Each supported payment processor will be implemented as a subclass of PaymentProcessor. PAYMENTPROCESSORS is a list of payment processor instances, currently only Stripe has been written. The first one in the list is the default for new customers. The implementations are in pay_processors.py. Go [here](stripe.md) for more information on setting up and using Stripe.

1. You can set up Google reCaptcha for production and development. Once a user successfully signs in, the IP address will be trusted for 90 days and Captcha will not be enforced during that period.

1. Setting VERIFY_TIMEOUT to a non-zero value enforces a time-out between sending verification emails to a particular email address or IP address. Like reCaptcha, this is an anti-spammer tool.

### Start the database

Once the app is installed and your settings_private.py file is configured you should restart py4web using the big green button on the Pythonanywhere console *Web* tab.

When first started the app creates an empty database in a databases/ folder in the py4web/apps/oxcam directory.

### Load a Minimal Database

Browse to the database at \<your_py4web_url\>/oxcam. You will be asked to login using your email. Oxcam sends a one-time
link to your email. The link opens a new tab ready for you to upload a copy of database contents:

![db_restore form](images/db_restore.png)

The kit contains a file, db_oxcam_minimal.csv in the py4web/apps/oxcam directory. Csv files are used to backup and restore the contents of the database.

The minimal database initializes the content copied from our OxCamNE database in the tables: Colleges, Email_Lists, Pages, CoA, Bank_Accounts, and Bank_Rules. Any and all of these tables you may wish to edit once your are up and running, for example many of the web pages may be inapplicable or need modification for your group.

To use the minimal database file, copy it from the kit to your local device where you browser is running. Click Browse and find the .csv file, then click restore. You will then need to login once more, and will be taken to the index page:

![inital index](images/Initial_index.png)

### Add yourself to the database

The database does not contain any member records so can not do anything very interesting. If you do not have membership configured, you'll see only the
mailing list option. Either joining the mailing list or as a member creates a
member record. The form to join the mailing list looks like:

![mailing list](images/mailing_list.png)

Once you have created your own record, as it is first into the database it is automatically assigned 'admin' access and all the function links appear on the navigation bar:

![navigation bar](images/navigation_bar.png)

If your group is for alumni of only one of the Universities, you may wish to eliminate the irrelevant Colleges. You can use **db_tool** to do this.

### Scheduled Tasks

Oxcam uses two additional tasks that run separately from the web server.
If your environment supports threads, and you configure 'THREAD_SUPPORT = True',
nothing more is needed:

- the email daemon runs all the time in its own thread. It's role is to spool
out notices to a mailing list or other selection of members. These emails may
be customized with a greeting or other information, such as registration details.

- the daily maintenance task is triggered at midnight local time each day. It's
role is to send out any necessary membership renewal reminders, and to generate
a database backup .csv file. It retains on the local drive the last month's daily files, and files from the 1st of each month for a year.

In the PythonAnywhere enviroment, the email daemon is configured as a 'run forever'
task, and the daily maintenance job is scheduled at a fixed UTC time daily. The commands to use are:

```bash
py4web/py4web.py call py4web/apps oxcam.email_daemon.email_daemon

py4web/py4web.py call py4web/apps oxcam.daily_maintenance.daily_maintenance
```
