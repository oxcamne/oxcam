## Pages Record

This record represents a publicly displayable web page.

This page is reached through the Edit button on an page row of the [Pages Page](pages.md):

![Pages page](images/pages_record.png)

The **back** link will take you back to the [Pages page](pages.md).

Similarly, the page's link is shown; it may be on an external site (specified in the **Link** field), or internal to the database (**Content** field of the pages record).

The **Content** is written in Markdown, and typically also includes HTML elements.

All the other fields are self explanatory or discussed on the [Pages Page](pages.md).

There are links to Markdown documentation and to HTML documentation, specifically discussing the inclusion and formatting around images.

When developing the page, after editing the Content, be sure to Submit your changes before returning to Edit and clicking the display link at the top of this page to display the effect.
